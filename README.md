## Architecture (concierge MVP)

The site is a **single static HTML file** served from GitHub Pages — no backend. Booking infrastructure is layered on top of Google services:

```
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │   index.html (static)     │   served from GitHub Pages
   │   + data/creatives.json   │
   └───────────┬───────────────┘
               │ (form submit)
               ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │  Google Apps Script       │   web app endpoint
   │  (POST → appendRow)       │
   └───────────┬───────────────┘
               │
               ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │  verbAfrica Bookings      │   Google Sheet → "Bookings" tab
   │  (source of truth)        │              → "Form Responses" tab (feedback)
   └───────────┬───────────────┘
               │
               ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │ alexander@verbafrica.co.za│   email notification per submission
   │  (alarm bell, swappable)  │
   └───────────────────────────┘
```

The **sheet is the source of truth.** Notification channels are swappable. See [`Operations/01_Booking_Playbook.md`](Operations/01_Booking_Playbook.md) for why.

The Apps Script setup is documented in [`Operations/03_Forms_Setup.md`](Operations/03_Forms_Setup.md) — useful if you ever need to redeploy or replace the endpoint.

## Working in this repo

**Editing creative data on the site** — `data/creatives.json` is the source. Edit there; the site picks it up on next page load. Internal notes live separately in `Cohort/*.md`.

**Editing the booking workflow** — the workflow itself is documented in `Operations/01_Booking_Playbook.md`. The form-to-sheet plumbing lives in the Google Apps Script attached to the *verbAfrica Bookings* sheet (Extensions → Apps Script).

**Deploying changes** — push to `main`. GitHub Pages rebuilds in ~30–60 seconds.

**Scheduled state-of-the-union** — a Claude scheduled task (`verbafrica-state-of-the-union`) runs every 3 days, catches up the Storyline, and flags stale Open Questions. Configured in the local Claude app.

## Working notes

- **No backend yet, by design.** Booking management is concierge (manual by Alexander). The decision to build a real backend gets made in Phase 5 review (December 2026), based on what the beta teaches us.
- **No public response-time promise.** Internal target is in `Operations/02_Response_Standards.md`.
- **Cohort phone/email are kept out of public HTML** for privacy. They live in `data/creatives.json` (which is technically public via the static site) — but the **render code only displays Instagram + the "Contact via verbAfrica" pill**. Real client contact always routes through Alexander during beta.
- **Pricing during beta = pass-through.** verbAfrica takes no cut. Revisited Phase 5.
